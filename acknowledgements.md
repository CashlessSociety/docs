# Acknowledgements

## We acknowledge the work of the great ecologies of kindness.

### We've come a long way. We would really like to express our great gratitude for a few people.

* To the minds that imagine our possibilities, and the hands, hearts, coding & creativity that achieve them
* To the growers and distributors of food, caretakers of the biosphere
* To the guardians who raised us and the elders who guided them when they too, acted like fools
* To the world that supports us despite our dumb decisions.

## Te Tiriti

As a Kiwi-initiated adventure whose membership now spans many nations, we acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the special relationship Tangata Whenua have with Aotearoa \(New Zealand\) and the indigenous sovereignty in many nations.   
  
International collaborators may occasionally come across Māori words or phrases which you may not be familiar with, but which . have entered the mainstream vernacular here in Aotearoa. If you want to know more about these concepts or didn't understand something, please don't hesitate to ask, chime in and someone will explain :-\)

_The practices of people who lived together, depending on- and in collaboration with- one another and the natural world is rarely more vital, more radical and revolutionary in all of history than it is today._
