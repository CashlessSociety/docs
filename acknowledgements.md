# Acknowledgements

## We acknowledge the work of the great ecologies of kindness.

#### We've come a long way. We would really like to express our great gratitude for a few people.

To the minds that imagine our possibilities, and the hands, hearts, coding & creativity that achieve them  
To the growers and distributors of food, caretakers of the biosphere  
To the guardians who raised us and the elders who guided them when they too, acted like fools  
To the world that supports us despite our dumb decisions.

#### and these folk in particular:

* Matthew Slater
* Toma≈æ Fleischman
* Edgar Cahn
* The Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, Aragon and many others
* Mr Satoshi and Mr Buterin
* Everyone who helped with Mutual Aid World & Good Good Beautiful

## Te Tiriti

As a Kiwi-initiated adventure whose membership now spans many nations, we acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the absolute sovereignty of tangata whenua in New Zealand, and the indigenous sovereignty of many nations. Sometimes we use Maori language to describe things. There are some really beautiful words and ideas baked into _Te Reo_ and if you want to know more about them or didn't understand something, always chime in and someone will explain :-\)

_The practices of people who lived together, depending on- and in collaboration with- one another and the natural world is rarely more vital, more radical and revolutionary in all of history than it is today._
