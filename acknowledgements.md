# Acknowledgements

<h2>We acknowledge the work of the great ecologies of kindness.</h2>
We've come a long way. We would really like to express our great gratitude for a few people ;-)

To the minds that imagine our possibilities, and the hands, hearts, coding & creativity that achieve them
To the growers and distributors of food, caretakers of the biosphere
To the guardians who raised us and the elders who guided them when they too, acted like fools
To the world that supports us despite our dumb decisions.

<h2>but in particular</h2>
- Matthew Slater
- Toma≈æ Fleischman
- Edgar Cahn
- The Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, Aragon and many others
- Mr Satoshi and Mr Buterin
- Everyone who helped with Mutual Aid World & Good Good Beautiful

<h2>Te Tiriti</h2>
As a Kiwi-initiated adventure whose membership now spans many nations, we acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the absolute sovereignty of tangata whenua in New Zealand, and the indigenous sovereignty of many nations.
