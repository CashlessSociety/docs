# Stuck? Go here :-\)

<h1>Credit clearing? Colony.io? Git-what?
	<h2>Don't worry, we've got your back</h2>

There can be a lot to get your head around in these sort of projects.
It's fine to feel confused or a bit out of your depth, we've been there!

One day we'll build a F.A.Q. here. For now (and always!) just get in touch - we're a team for a reason after all! :-)

<h2>Just reach out</h2>
There are lots of folk in <a href="https://discord.gg/EfSwMEXmtg">the Discord</a> who are happy to help. Jump in and ask away in any channel, or reach out to Dean Harliwich or Miles any time :-)
