BLOCK - Set up Trello CRM
Link to typeform [done]

BLOCK/Alongside - Gitbook
The gitbook documents should be in place as a really-MVP.
Draw up what's in the book [~80% done]

BLOCK - Advisors
[Things we probably need before Approaching Advisors include: 1: Definitely - Prelim Colony setup 2) Probably gitbook documentation.]

Brainstorm - Identify first round of advisors to approach
 - book date for this convo (soon)
Talks with individuals (one on one - allow 4 weeks to find space to warm up, but expected to be approaching them week 1)
[/Approaching advisors closes]
[Advisors begin to trickle in across time, we somehow orient them, also collecting any agreements/signatures required]  - DEPENDENCY - CRM [& Gitbook?]
All advisors(ish) are in, first call together, group whakawhanaungatanga [how is this done without the nightmarish qualities of zoom - maybe do a call-only format (Lex Fridman mentioned this new internet call group phenomona...)]
Add advisors to site & issue tokens
[Begin Public self-invite phase when? as a trigger from the completion of Advisors task would be the conservative approach.
Probably important also that the environment be suited to the advisors preferences/modes of working to some extent, first & foremost? 

ALONGSIDE - Build External Schedule
