Tame your Github notifications
- If you want, you can unfollow 
Click the bell up the top right of Github (it probably has a blue circle on it)
Go to "Update watching settings" [https://github.com/watching]. From here click "Participating and @mentions" to unwatch notes from github in which you aren't mentioned/ don't participate in.
