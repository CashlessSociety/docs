"Although the community members (ourselves included) aren’t really assigned “jobs”, members seem to be flowing through zones based on energy level, internal work demand, personal capabilities, and preferences.

We’ve identified three main Contribution Zones so far: Casual, Core, & Staff."



(1) CASUAL: Signaling, passive activity, varied financial investment.

Casual contributors can participate very flexibly on an ad-hoc basis. They're invested in DAO success and complete available tasks (bounties) when they desire.

(2) CORE: Production, moderate activity, moderate financial investment.

Core Contributors are responsible for getting stuff done within their respective domain. They push forward the agenda, create bounty opportunities, and engage other stakeholders throughout the process.

(3) STAFF: Stewardship, high activity, high financial investment.

Staff members are responsible for enacting the community voice and making high-level decisions around product and vision. In other words, making sure the DAO is pointed in the right direction.

'These zones shift the operational focus from a central process of “distinct jobs and activities” to a member-led process based on “commitment and investment level.” - [ well suited to Colony model]
