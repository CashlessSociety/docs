# Getting Started

## Welcome to Cashless Society!

### _**Cashless is an alternative way to keep track of credit through communities.**_ 

We're working to help people **do more together** by **creating better access to credit**. Cashless App will do this by connecting people with skills to people with needs, and intelligently tracking networks of sharing in community.

_"We provide trust and transparency but you are your own bank."_

## **You're invited**

We're building a DAO \([`what's that?`](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20autonomous%20organization%20%28DAO,and%20managed%20by%20their%20members.)\) and plan to acknowledge everyone who helps with both a stake in the project and a say in the governance decisions. 

You don't have to join the DAO to contribute and participate, but know this - **the work that you do is awesome**, it's important! We wouldn't have reached out to share the project with you so early if it wasn't.

We would love for you to join us and take part at whatever level feels right for you. From lurking in the discord, to connecting us with people we ought to know, to getting hands-on with discussions & teamwork. 

There are 4 quick steps to getting on board and you can dive right in. 

1. [ ] **Be clear what we're about:** Read through [vision & values](vision-and-values/vision-and-values.md) and [our website](https://cashless.social/)
2. [ ] **Agree to be kind:** Read and sign the [code of conduct](key-resources/code-of-conduct.md) so you know what's fair community behaviour.
3. [ ] **Put your hand up:** Fill in our [typeform](https://deanharliwich.typeform.com/to/erYOECZh) so we know you're interested and can get in touch with you.
4. [ ] **Come say hi:** Jump on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EfSwMEXmtg) and join the conversation!

Easy :-\) You're in! If you want to sign up as a member of the DAO, hold tight, we're working on that. For now we can't wait to see you in the Discord, or in the weekly [open catchups](https://bbb.hypha.coop/b/mil-l9s-elb-tws) held every Wednesday, [9am NZT](https://time.is/0900_14_Apr_2021_in_Wellington/Vancouver/EDT/Brazil) \(GMT+12\).

If you have any quizzes, questions or queries, don't hesitate to reach out and get in touch.  
Stay great, have fun out there!
