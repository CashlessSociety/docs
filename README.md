# Getting Started

## Welcome to Cashless Society!

### _**Cashless is an alternative way to keep track of credit through communities.**_

We're working to help people **do more together** by **creating better access to credit**. Cashless App will do this by connecting people with skills to people with needs, and intelligently tracking networks of sharing in community.

_"We provide trust and transparency but you are your own bank."_

## **You're invited**

If you were invited to read this website, it's probably because **the work that you do is awesome.** It's important! We wouldn't have reached out to share the project with you so early on if it wasn't.  
  
We're organising ourselves as a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation this allow us to acknowledge people who contribute meaningfully to this project with a project token. Project tokens give you both a financial stake in the the project as well as a say in the future of the project long term. [`You can read about DAOs here`](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20autonomous%20organization%20%28DAO,and%20managed%20by%20their%20members.) 

We would love for you to join us and take part at whatever level feels right for you. From lurking in the discord, to connecting us with people we ought to know, to getting hands-on with discussions & teamwork.

There are 4 quick steps to getting on board and you can dive right in.

1. [ ] **Be clear what we're about:** Read through [vision & values](vision-and-values/vision-and-values.md) and [our website](https://cashless.social/)
2. [ ] **Agree to be kind:** Read and sign the [code of conduct](key-resources/code-of-conduct.md) so you know what's fair community behaviour.
3. [ ] **Put your hand up:** Fill in our [typeform](https://deanharliwich.typeform.com/to/erYOECZh) so we know you're interested and can get in touch with you.
4. [ ] **Touch base on zoom:** The  next step is for us to have a bit of a chat and see if we're aligned. If that works out you'll get an invite to **join our discord group** and ****we can see what develops from there.

 If you want to sign up as a member of the DAO the next step is to sign our MOU. But we're still working on the exact structure of that. For now we can't wait to see you in the Discord, or in the weekly [open catchups](https://bbb.hypha.coop/b/mil-l9s-elb-tws) held every Wednesday, [9am NZT](https://time.is/0900_14_Apr_2021_in_Wellington/Vancouver/EDT/Brazil) \(GMT+12\).

If you have any questions or queries, please don't hesitate to reach out and get in touch.  
  
Stay great, have fun out there!
