# Governance & Tokens \(Dare to DAO\)

<h1>We're doing a DAO</h1>

<h2>Credit given where credit's due</h2>

"Cashless is an organisation of people building software and communities that run on top of that protocol."

We seriously believe in creating things together and everyone getting value from it.
We also seriously believe in everyone having the opportunity to lead what they build together.

We're working hard alongside Commons experts, Token & DAO-heads to build a decentralized structure that supports this. 

<h2>Recognition // Coin Offering </h2>

Cashless.dao will work with a twin-token system of credit - In exchange for helping out, you can earn a stake in the project and earn votes to use in decision-making at the same time.

<h3>Tokens for governance</h3>

Tokens for governance will be issued for completing projects and participating in discussions like our weekly video calls. If you take part in building Cashless app (whether conversations or coding), DAO members will get a say in the future of the app.

Governance tokens are not currently available for sale, but there will eventually be a coin offering that will also allow investors to take part in our success.

<h3>Tokens for helping with projects</h3>

You don't have to be part of our organisation to contribute to the protocol, but if you want to become a member of the DAO you can earn governance tokens that will give you voting rights in the DAO and a share of any profits generated down the line.

<h3>Chip in and build a DAO with your name on it</h3>
<b>None of this is final</b>. DAO & token governance are something that's still emerging across the world in a big way.
We have an <span style="font-size:4em"><b>MOU [LINK MOU]</span></b> highlighting the plan so far, but we are just setting out with Colony.io are learning all the time. If this is something that interests you, jump into #dao-governance in <a href="https://discord.gg/EfSwMEXmtg">the discord</a> and join the conversation! We'd love to hear your thoughts.
