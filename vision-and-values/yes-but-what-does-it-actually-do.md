# Yes, but what does it actually DO?

## Everyone _looooves_ de-fi.

Flashwords like _token bonding curve_ and _decentralized finance_ are fine, but _what does it actually mean?_ Vision & values weren't enough? Good. Let's take a look at the technicals.

### `How it works`

**Exchange works because of credit and agreement to respect each other, not coins.**

Most of the time a dollar isn't a dollar. People who pay us don't pour dollars into our bank accounts, and we don't lift them out to exchange them for goods and services.

Just like Cashless credits, a dollar is a promise to pay - a promise that whoever holds it can put it back into the money system \(_economy_\) later and get a dollar's worth of value out in exchange. If there's trust and respect between you and someone else, chances are you could make a trade with them using a couple of sticks, a shiny rock, or a bit of paper with an "i.o.u" on it. 

With modern _credit clearing, y_ou add or remove a credit \(or many\) from a record kept by the bank, and it's added or removed from someone else's account. What this means is that **credit moving between people fuels the exchange of value**. ****That's why [_credit unions_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp), [_micro-credit_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microcredit.asp) and [_community banks_](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-a-community-bank-5069678) are well known to be effective ways to lift communities out of poverty. 

Cashless leverages recent advances in distributed finance and cryptography to do the same thing without banks, and without interest, in a much more scalable way.

**Pay, get paid, with time, credit or money**

With the app you can 

1. Send anyone payment in the form of a cashless credit**,** dollar reserves, or time \(provide an helpful service as counterpayment\).
2. Receive payment from anyone, and accept payment in the form of goods and services, $$ or tokens.
3. List skills you'd like to exchange and set hourly rates for contributing those skills.

**Extend credit to anyone, even non-members**

Send anyone money in the form of a cashless credit. A credit is a signed, irrevocable ‘promise to pay it forward’ backed by your crypto \(or dollar\) reserves and reputation. Send a credit as payment or acknowledgement of work done for you by others. They don't have to be a member, you can send credit to any email address or social media handle.

**Money only works because of trust** _\(The Three Guarantees\)_
