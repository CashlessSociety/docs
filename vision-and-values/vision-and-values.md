# Vision & Values

## Financially Free, Together.

**Cashless works to help people do more together by creating better access to credit.**  
  
We are building an app and **a** protocol to:

1. **Make it easy to extend credit** to the people you choose to trust, and;
2. **Connect communities** into networks that can trust each other and share together better.

Our hope in doing so is to help people be the source of their own wealth, instead of depending on harmful financial paradigms like interest-bearing debt. _The world needs regenerative ways to cooperate - to share and exchange value. We won't be doing it alone._

### **The cornerstone of this collaboration:** _**good people working on peer-to-peer mutual credit:**_

We recognize these values as seriously cool, and the vital forces of our endeavour. By taking part in a Cashless Society, we agree to uphold these principles, with the vision of seeing more of them in the world.

_**Cashless envisions a future that is:**_

* **Fair** - Reducing inequality is at the heart of what we are doing.
* **Robust** - By distributing risk we are building a form of credit suited to changeable times ahead.
* **Compassionate** - We believe in a kinder and gentler form of money.
* **Transparent** - Data needs boundaries but corruption, inequality and instability grow in darkness.
* **Distributed** - We are building structures that put the user in control of their own data, and their own credit.

## Committed to open source

Cashless is an open source MPL licensed protocol with a truly open source reference implementation. There are no 'hooks' or embedded crypto tokens required to run it. We want anyone and everyone to be able to build on this protocol. 

### **Business model**

We're mission driven. Our primary goal is to create new, more friendly, more human centered ways of organizing and collaborating as people and building mutual credit. The mission comes first. But, acting as a non-profit is not an effective long term strategy to have the kind of impact we are aiming to create. ****

For this reason we're organising as a DAO and aim to generate a return for our contributors and investors by building value-add products on top of the open protocol.

Cashless hopes to create a million communities that build on top of the open protocol. Their success directly influences our success and vice versa. This will generate revenue in two ways:

1. Cashless will make early investments \(and eventually automated investments\) in the communities that issue community tokens on top of Cashless protocol, using Cashless software. 
2. Cashless will be building an AI recommendation business, which will essentially act as a concierge to facilitate credit worthy transactions. It won't be necessary to use this particular app, but it will be an option amongst many that allows you to interact with the protocol in a way optimized for your success.
