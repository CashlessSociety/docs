# Vision & Values

## Financially Free, Together.

**Cashless works to help people do more together by creating better access to credit.  
We are building an app and protocol to:**

1. **Make it easy to extend credit** to the people you choose to trust, and;
2. Connect communities into networks that can trust each other and **share better together**.

Our hope in doing so is to help people be the source of their own wealth, instead of depending on harmful financial paradigms like interest-bearing debt \(yuck\). _The world needs regenerative ways to share and exchange value. We won't be doing it alone._

#### **The cornerstone of this collaboration:** _**good people working on peer-to-peer mutual credit:**_

We recognize these values as seriously cool, and the vital forces of our endeavour. By taking part in a Cashless Society, we agree to uphold these principles, with the vision of seeing more of them in the world.

_**Cashless envisions a future that is:**_

**Fair** - Reducing inequality is at the heart of what we are doing.  
**Robust** - By distributing risk we are building a form of credit suited to changeable times ahead.  
**Compassionate** - We believe in a kinder and gentler form of money.  
**Transparent** - Data needs boundaries but corruption, inequality and instability grow in darkness.  
**Distributed** - We are building structures that put the user in control of their own data, and their own credit.

## Committed to open source

Cashless is an open source MPL licensed protocol with a truly open source reference implementation.  
There are no 'hooks' or embedded crypto tokens required to run it.  
We want anyone and everyone to be able to build on this protocol. We will make money by building value-add products on top of the open protocol.
