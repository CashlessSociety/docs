# Vision & Values

## Financially Free, Together.

**Cashless works to help people do more together by creating better access to credit.  
The world needs regenerative ways to share and exchange value. We won't be doing it alone.**

The boundary of this collaboration is _good people working on peer-to-peer mutual credit which is_:

**Fair** - Reducing inequality is at the heart of what we are doing.  
**Robust** - By distributing risk we are building a form of credit suited to changeable times ahead.  
**Compassionate** - We believe in a kinder and gentler form of money.  
**Transparent** - Data needs boundaries but corruption, inequality and instability grow in darkness.  
**Distributed** - We are building structures that put the user in control of their own data, and their own credit.

## Committed to open source

Cashless is an open source MPL licensed protocol with a truly open source reference implementation.  
There are no 'hooks' or embedded crypto tokens required to run it.  
We want anyone and everyone to be able to build on this protocol. We will make money by building value-add products on top of the open protocol.
