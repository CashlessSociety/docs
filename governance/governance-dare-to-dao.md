# Governance (Dare to DAO)

## Credit given where credit's due

_**"Cashless is an organization of people building software and communities that run on top of that protocol."**_

We seriously believe in creating things together and everyone getting value from it.\
We also seriously believe in everyone having the opportunity to lead what they build together.

We're working hard alongside commons experts, Token & DAO-heads to build a decentralized structure that supports this.

## Recognition - what you do _matters_

Cashless.dao will work with a twin-token system of credit - In exchange for helping out, you can earn a stake in the project and earn votes to use in decision-making at the same time.

You don't have to be part of our organization to contribute to the protocol, but if you want to become a member of the DAO, you can earn governance tokens that will give voting rights in the DAO and a share of any profits generated down the line.

### Tokens for governance

Tokens for governance will be issued for completing projects and participating in discussions like our weekly video calls. If you take part in building Cashless app (whether conversations or coding), DAO members will get a say in the future of the app.

Governance tokens are not currently available for sale, but there will eventually be a coin offering that will also allow investors to take part in our success.

### Tokens for helping with projects

Use your skills and get paid in stake. Easy.

When you're active in a project, you'll be credited through [_Colony.io_](https://colony.io) for your time & contribution to whatever you're working on.

Tokens can be held (invested) and will gain value over time as _we_ gain value over time, traded out for fiat \$$ (a.k.a "Old money"), or exchanges for services traded by other members of the group (things like design & tech work, professional consultation etc).

As the project grows, the value of project tokens will grow. We'll use careful design and clever de-fi strategies like [token bonding curves](https://medium.com/coinmonks/token-bonding-curves-explained-7a9332198e0e) to create robust, reliable, _valuable_ tokens that you can use meaningfully to get things done, because after all:

> **"**We're working to help people **do more together** by **creating better access to credit**.**"**

## Chip in and build a DAO with your name on it

**None of this is final. You're invited to help create it.**

DAO & token governance are something that's still emerging across the world in a big way. We have a **Memorandum of Understanding \[LINK MOU]** that highlights the plan so far, but we are just setting out with Colony.io, and are learning all the time.

If this interests you, we want you to take part! <3 Jump into #dao-governance in the discord and join the conversation, we'd love to hear your thoughts. If you haven't joined yet, check out Getting Started or our [Typeform](https://mp72k7t29rj.typeform.com/to/GfVdv7Uz).
