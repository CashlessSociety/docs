  Everybody loves saving the world but what are the details? For now a lot of
  documentation is still actively in progress, but we do have working code and a
  lot of theory almost ready to go.

# Yes, but what does it actually do?

### The code

* The Ethereum smart contracts code, [here](https://github.com/CashlessSociety/cashless).
* Code for the proof of concept (deployed to main net late 2020) [here](https://github.com/CashlessSociety/cashless-express).
* The code for our more user friendly MVP [here](https://github.com/CashlessSociety/cashless-ui).
* Our MVP roadmap[ here](https://github.com/CashlessSociety/cashless-ui/issues/120)
* Smart contract (on ethereum) address [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c30cc03246443d6c9e211c298bbd94ef889151e#code) 

### **Proof of concept (video)**

This proof of concept is quite old now. Karen has helped us a lot in creating a much more friendly user interface. But fwiw here**'**s a video of the proof of concept.

### Whitepaper

The whitepaper is a work in progress so we can't show it right now, however this paper from 2019 gives some context on the core ideas.
